            JOIN LIFE REPRESENTS A PROCESS OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, OF CONSTANTLY QUESTIONING OURSELVES WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO ADVANCE TO A MORE SUSTAINABLE MODEL. WE KNOW THAT THE ROAD IS COMPLEX, BUT WE BELIEVE IN THE INDUSTRYâ€™S POWER OF TRANSFORMATION. AS SUCH, OUR SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES HAVE BECOME MORE RIGOROUS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IMPROVING.
